# Poker

### Purpose
The purpose of this repository is ultimately to beat my friends at Texas Hold 'Em.
I am a very competitive person and want to beat my friends when we play casually on the weekends.
The ultimate goal of this is to be able to use this repository every round in order to generate what I should bet on each hand to make money in the long run.

### Elements

Currently this repository only contains "Poker Deck.py" which is my script to model the outcomes of the style of Texas Hold 'Em that my friends and I play at college.
In the near future more items will be added into this repository to further develop the project that I had envisioned when I started.

##### Limitations of "Poker Deck.py"
One Item that I should note. "Poker Deck" is a simple model to simulate Texas Hold 'Em. 
It can tell who the winners and losers are. 
However, it has not been told how to deal with ties yet. I began trying to implement code to accurately reflect which player would really win in a tie.
I was an extra 1-200 lines deep and had only been able to flush out a few of the "easy" ties before I stopped.
If this project wasn't personal then I would have developing until the project was perfect.
But this was a passion project from the start and continuing to work on aspects of determining who would in a tie began to make the project not fun.
So, I decided to stop pursing that direction.
Plus, the extra time spent on developing those little and rare details would not have been worth it compared to the amount of money that I would have won.

What I am trying to say is that, you should not take the results or probabilities given from "Poker Deck.py" as exact results of a perfectly competitive poker game.
Like all models, it only gets the game mostly right.

### Labor
Another reason that I started this project was to demonstrate the programming abilities that I posses.
I have no formal education in computer science, everything that I know about programming is self-taught.
I wanted to create this project to go beyond the scope that my repository previously held with projects that barely stretched more than 30 lines and were not complex.

Another piece to note about this project, is that all the code written is 100% by me. I never grabbed anything from StackOverflow or any other online forum.
I also almost never had to reference outside resources other than to remember what a function or method did.
You can probably tell this because the code that I have written is by no means concise, and is probably not terribly readable, even with my comments.

### Usage
Anyone is welcome to use this code if they so please.
Honestly, you don't even have to give me credit for it.
If you do use it and end up finding bugs please contact me.
I believe that I removed all of the bugs with the code, but are bugs really ever gone?
